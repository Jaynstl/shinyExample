## shinyExample

*shinyExample* calls a Shiny app which can run R-, Octave- of Stata programs which produce only console output or one plot.

Clicking on the ![](ExampleButton2.png) opens a sidebar which allows further operations:

* Viewing the source code, the console output and the plot separately
* Download the source code, the console output or a PDF file of the plot 
* Loading another program snippet
* Rerun the current program snippet
* Load results of older reruns of the current program snippet

The Shiny app will run in R, but of course is intended to be embedded via an *iframe* into web pages. With URL given you can determine the starting parameters of the app. The URL

https://shinyapps.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/examples?P=stat/Statistik/lottozahlen.R&V=P

forces the example app to open the given program (assumed it exists on the server) and to show the plot window. For *MediaWiki* exists the [Iframe extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Iframe) to embed the app.

Following query parameters exists

* *P=* path and name of program to run
    + *xxx.R* denotes a [R](https://www.r-project.org/) program
    + *xxx.m* denotes a [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) program
    + *xxx.do* denotes a [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) progfamm
* *V=* view of program result with three possible values: *Source*, *Console* or *Plot*
* *W=* width of plot (in pixel, default: 800)
* *H=* height of plot (in pixel, default: 600)
* *S=* some sizenames for the plot, e.g. *VGA* for 640x480. Note that seting *W* and/or *H* overwrites the settings from *S* 
* *L=* link to an specific version of output (if not given *L=0000000000000* is assumed) 

## Installing the app on Shiny server

1. You copy everything under *inst/examples* into a shiny apps directoy of the server, e.g. */srv/shiny-server/examples*
2. The subdirectory *tmp* should be writetable for the Shiny server. Here you should place also all the data files you example programs might need.
3. The subdirectory *R* contains your example programs, maybe with a further subdirectory structure.
