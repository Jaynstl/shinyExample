## Installation from github

To install the package from GitHub use the [devtools package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools):

> devtools::install_github('sigbertklinke/shinyExample')

__Notes__:

1. To use the Shiny app you need to have installed [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) and [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) before.
2. The app may not work on Windows systems.

## shinyExample

*shinyExample* allows you to run R-, Octave- of Stata programs which produce only console output or one plot. For teaching purposes the source coude, the console output and the plot can be viewed. The app supports some limited interactivity: you can rerun the program which is especially in the framework of inferential statistics useful to show the influence of drawing a new (random) sample.

### Interactive app

Clicking on the ![](ExampleButton2.png) opens a sidebar which allows further operations.

* __Source__ : view source code
* __Console__ : view console output (including source code)
* __Plot__ : view plot output (if any)
* __Run again__ : rerun current program, the result will have an embedded a time stamp of the current time
* __0__ : rerun current program, the result will have an embedded a time stamp of '0' (= 1:00:00, 1 Jan 1970)
* __Download__ : download the source code (TXT), the console output (TXT) or the plot (PDF) depending on the current view 
* __File select__ : select another program stored at the server
* __History__ : load the result from a previous run of the current program

The Shiny app will run in R (via `runShinyExample()`), but of course is intended to be embedded via an *iframe* into web pages. With URL given you can determine the starting parameters of the app. The URL

https://shinyapps.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/examples?P=stat/Statistik/lottozahlen.R&V=P

forces the example app to open the given program (assumed it exists on the server) and to show the plot window. For *MediaWiki* exists the [Iframe extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Iframe) to embed the app.

Following query parameters exists

* *P=* path and name of program to run
    + *xxx.R* denotes a [R](https://www.r-project.org/) program
    + *xxx.m* denotes a [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) program
    + *xxx.do* denotes a [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) progfamm
* *V=* view of program result with three possible values: *Source*, *Console* or *Plot*
* *W=* width of plot (in pixel, default: 800)
* *H=* height of plot (in pixel, default: 600)
* *S=* some sizenames for the plot, e.g. *VGA* for 640x480. Note that seting *W* and/or *H* overwrites the settings from *S* 
* *L=* link to an specific version of output (if not given *L=0000000000000* is assumed) 

### Static app

Since each run of a program creates a set of HTML pages you can also embed these HTML pages rather the app itself. In web page you should not embed more than __four__ apps, otherwise the server will not be able to display empty results. If you once made a program which produced a good plot or output then can click on __STATIC__ link to get the URL for this plot or output. If you embed that link into your webpage then you will this HTML page with __INTERACTIVE__ link to the app.

## Installing the app on a Shiny server

1. You copy everything under *inst/examples* into a shiny apps directoy of the server, e.g. */srv/shiny-server/examples*
2. The subdirectories *rds*, *run* and *tmp* should be writetable for the Shiny server. 
3. Place all necessary data files your example programs might need into the subdirectory *run*
3. The subdirectory *R* contains your example programs, maybe with a further subdirectory structure.
